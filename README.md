- [Optional] Docker (for container usage)

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gl1tch0x1/contey.git 
cd contey
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 3: Set Up Log Directory

By default, logs are read from:

```bash
~/honeypot_logs/
```

Create it if it doesn't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/honeypot_logs
```

You can change the location by editing `LOG_DIR` in `app.py`.

---

### Step 4: Run the Honeypot Dashboard

```bash
chmod +x honeypot.sh
./honeypot.sh
```

This will:

✅ Start the Flask server  
✅ Run the honeypot (optional addition)  
✅ Schedule the email log delivery  
✅ Start monitoring services

---

## 📩 Email Log Delivery Setup

During the first run of `honeypot.sh`, it will prompt you:

1. For your **Gmail address** (no password is required)
2. It sets up hourly sending of logs in PDF format via `email_logs.sh`.

Make sure your system has:

- `sendmail` or an SMTP-compatible client
- `enscript` and `ps2pdf` for PDF log formatting

If not installed:

```bash
sudo apt install enscript ghostscript sendmail
```

---

## 🔄 Updating the Project

Run the update script:

```bash
chmod +x update.sh
./update.sh
```

This fetches the latest version from your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/gl1tch0x1/contey`) and restarts necessary services.

---

## 🐳 Docker Support (Optional)

To build and run in Docker:

```bash
docker build -t contey .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 contey
```

---

## 🔐 Security Tips

- Logs are only viewable from your local network.
- No passwords are stored — Gmail password is never saved.
- You can extend security with Basic Auth or Nginx reverse proxy.
